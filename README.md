### Image Analysis  

This repository contains materials and tasks related to the **Image Analysis** course, offered in the fifth semester of Applied Computer Science at AGH University of Krakow.  

## Course Overview  
The course focuses on fundamental and advanced methods of **image processing and analysis** using **MATLAB**, covering topics such as:  

- **Basic image processing algorithms**: grayscale conversion, histogram normalization, brightness adjustment, scaling, rotation, and edge detection.  
- **Image segmentation and feature extraction** for object recognition.  
- **Binary image processing**: thresholding, erosion, dilation, and skeletonization.  
- **Noise reduction techniques**: implementation and comparison of various denoising algorithms.  
- **Pattern recognition and classification** of objects based on extracted features.  

## Laboratory Exercises  
Laboratory sessions focused on **hands-on implementation of image processing algorithms in MATLAB**, including:  

- **Basic operations**: implementing negative filters, grayscale conversion, and histogram normalization.  
- **Binary image processing**: thresholding methods and evaluation of segmentation effectiveness.  
- **Noise filtering**: applying and testing different noise reduction techniques.  
- **Morphological operations**: erosion, dilation, opening, and closing transformations.  
- **Feature extraction and shape analysis**: skeletonization techniques like KMM, K3M, and medial axis transform.  
- **Applying advanced filters** such as **Gabor filter** for texture detection.  

The repository includes **MATLAB code, reports, and notes from laboratory sessions**, covering theoretical concepts and practical implementations.
